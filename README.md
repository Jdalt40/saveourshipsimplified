V1.0
Save Our Ship Basic

A simple mod that just saves your ship and be able to transfer your colonists and stuff to another map.
Ships doesnt have insides so if you want that check out saveourship reloaded.

I know Save Our Ship Reloaded exists but it has performance issues and so i created this.
Also this is my first mod. Save compatible for both adding and removing

There are sometimes errors when loading game if you could find the cause i would be very happy :D
